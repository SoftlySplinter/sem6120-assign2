\section{Introduction}
This report investigates the use of Genetic Algorithms to solve the Travelling
Salesman Problem, introducing both topics as well as previous research and 
techniques.

Following this the design for the solution implemented will be detailed,
focusing from high level system design to annotated code section to explain the
choice behind the implementation.

This implementation is then used to produced the results in
section~\ref{sec:results} which give an insight into the affects of different
crossover and mutation schemes on the performance of the genetic algorithm,
specifically looking at %TODO actually get some results to finish this.

Finally the author will draw conclusions from these results and %TODO I don't
% know what I'm going to do at this point.


\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}
Genetic algorithms are a biologically-inspired approach to heuristic search 
that mimic natural selection. Unlike many other evolutionary strategies and
evolutionary programming, they are not designed to solve a specific problem,
but are designed to solve the problem of optimisation which is made difficult
by substantial complexity and uncertainty\cite{Holland1992Adaptation}.

\subsection{Travelling Salesman Problem}
%TODO this section need citations.
The Travelling Salesman Problem is a well-known NP-hard optimisation problem
which asks the question: \textit{``Given a number of cities and the distances 
between these cities, find the shortest touch which visits each city exactly 
once and returns to the first city.''}

Assuming each city is connected to every other city, this problem reaches a
complexity of $O(n!)$ and is very resource intensive to brute force a problem
with any decent number of nodes quickly become too larger problem to solve
within a reasonable amount of time.

There are many heuristic algorithms which have been applied successfully to the
Travelling Salesman Problem, including both Evolutionary and Genetic 
Algorithms.

Though the nature of Genetic Algorithms are suited to the optimisation of a
Travelling Salesman Problem, normal methods of crossover and mutation cannot,
generally, be applied directly to the problem. The representation of 
chromosomes has to be ordered (i.e.\ each city must appear once and only once)
and additional methods of crossover and mutation have had to be designed for
these ordered chromosomes.

\section{Design}
% TODO Introduction

\subsection{System Design}
% TODO
% Overall idea: modularise system
%  - Define high-level classes for selection, crossover & mutation
%  - Use factories to generate specific classes based of input
%  - Discuss the structure of graphs and ways to cut down the amount of memory
%    used.




\subsubsection{UML Class Diagram}

Figure~\ref{fig:uml} shows the initial UML Class diagram for this project.
There are some elements which break from typical object-orientated design,
noticeably the representation of nodes in a graph as a map of integers to a
turple of float, these parts are done so to re-use internal data structures of
the Python programming language to speed up the implementation of many 
features.

\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/uml.png}
\caption{UML Class Diagram for the Genetic Algorithm}
\label{fig:uml}
\end{figure}

This design is such that factories exist to create selection schemes, crossover
schemes and mutators based on an input string to facilitate the switching of
these elements via command line arguments.

This design was slowly improved through the project; the
\texttt{CrossoverScheme} class implemented the \texttt{crossover} method, 
which then called a separate method, \texttt{do\_crossover}, to generate 
\texttt{c1} based on \texttt{do\_crossover(p1, p2)} and \texttt{c2} on 
\texttt{do\_crossover(p2, p1)} to make the processing more uniform. Subclasses
were still able to override the \texttt{crossover} method, but were encouraged
to implement a \texttt{do\_crossover} method unless the scheme required a
different behaviour of child generation.


\subsubsection{Representation of Graphs}

The actual of representation of a graph is a map of the node identifier to the
$x$ and $y$ co-ordinates of that node (as a tuple). This allows easy look up 
of nodes within the map to get the position of the node. This was chosen 
because of the representation of the problem in chromosomes - each gene 
represents a node in the graph.

With this representation, the fitness function would be the distance of the 
tour represented by these nodes:

\begin{equation}
d_{tour} = \sum^{N}_{i=0}{
  \begin{cases}
    d(n_i, n_{i+1}) & \text{if } i+n < N \\ 
    d(n_i, n_0)     & \text{else}
  \end{cases}
}
\end{equation}

Programatically, with the advantage of the functional and in-built elements of 
Python, this can be simplified to:

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Distance of a tour]
def d_tour():
  # Move the first element of the array to the end.
  shifted = nodes[1:] + nodes[:1]
  return sum([distance(i, j) for (i, j) in zip(nodes, shifted)])
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Use of Functional Programming Paradigms}

As Python implements several different programming paradigms a lot of problems
can be solved with a different approach than other languages can. Both genetic
algorithms and the travelling salesman problem lend themselves towards a more
functional approach with a lot of list processing. Using Pythons list
comprehensions and the in-built list functions shortened the amount of code 
required and makes the code a lot easier to understand for those who are used 
to this approach.

A very good example of this is the method for evaluating chromosomes in a
population, returning a list sorted from the best to the worst:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, 
                   caption=Using function elements to improve sustinctness and
                           readability]
def eval(population):
  return sorted(map(eval_single, population), 
                key = lambda chromosome: chromosome.score)

def eval_single(chromosome):
  chromosome.score = chromosome.fitness()
  return chromosome
\end{lstlisting}
