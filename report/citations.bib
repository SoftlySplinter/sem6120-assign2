    abstract = {In a standard genetic algorithm ({GA}), individuals reproduce asexually: any two organisms may be parents in crossover. Gender separation and sexual selection here inspire a model of gendered {GA} in which crossover takes place only between individuals of opposite sex and the {GA}'s evaluation, selection, and mutation strategies depend on gender. Consequently, a pattern of cross-gender cooperation and intra-gender competition emerges. A symbiotic relation between the selection and crossover operators also arises. Experimental results prove this strategy to be advantageous, significantly outperforming the standard {GA}, both in number of generations required and in the quality of solutions.},

@inproceedings{Whitley1989GENITOR,
    abstract = {This paper reports work done over the past three years using rank-based allocation of reproductive trials. New evidence and arguments are presented which suggest that allocating reproductive trials according to rank is superior to fitness proportionate reproduction. Ranking can not only be used to slow search speed, but also to increase search speed when appropriate. Furthermore, the use of ranking provides a degree of control over selective pressure that is not possible with fitness proportionate reproduction. The use of rank-based allocation of reproductive trials is discussed in the context of 1) Holland's schema theorem, 2) {DeJong}'s standard test suite, and 3) a set of neural net optimization problems that are larger than the problems in the standard test suite. The {GENITOR} algorithm is also discussed; this algorithm is specifically designed to allocate reproductive trials according to rank.},

Specifically, proportionate reproduction, ranking selection, tournament selection, and Genitor (or \^{A}«steady state") selection are compared on the basis of solutions to deterministic difference or differential equations, which are verified through computer simulations. The analysis provides convenient approximate or exact solutions as well as useful convergence time and growth ratio estimates. The paper recommends practical application of the analyses and suggests a number of paths for more detailed analytical investigation of selection techniques.

    abstract = {Tournament selection is a useful and robust selection mechanism commonly used by genetic algorithms. The selection pressure of tournament selection directly varies with the tournament size --- the more competitors, the higher the resulting selection pressure. This article develops a model, based on order statistics, that can be used to quantitatively predict the resulting selection pressure of a tournament of a given size. This model is used to predict the convergence rates of genetic algorithms utilizing tournament selection. While tournament selection is often used in conjunction with noisy (imperfect) fitness functions, little is understood about how the noise affects the resulting selection pressure. The model is extended to quantitatively predict the selection pressure for tournament selection utilizing noisy fitness functions. Given the tournament size and noise level of a noisy fitness function, the extended model is used to predict the resulting selection pressure of tournament...},
